# SongLyricsGenerator
This is a simple project meant to practice my programming skills.
## How it works
It is a python command line program where it automatically identifies what song is currently playing on your spotify account using Spotify API and spotipy library.
After it identifies the song, it will print out the Song title and Artist name which will then be used to automatically generate lyrics using Genius API and lyricsgenius library.
## Limitations
1. You have to re-run the program after each song.
2. There are other informations included in the lyrics that are irrelevant.
3. This is for personal use.
